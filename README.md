# WOTR_WoljifRomanceMod

Follow the full romance path for Woljif Jefto that should have been in the game to begin with. The romance path is available for both male and female characters, and begins in Act 3, with content continuing through the rest of the game up to and including the epilogue. At last you can give the tiefling the love he deserves, but winning his heart won't be easy...

Be aware that like official owlcat romances, this romance path contains wilderness camping events, command room events, and in-base dialogs, as well as additional content in existing scenes! You will miss out on content if you don't set up camp in wilderness maps once in a while, or if you don't ever visit the command room.

## How to Install

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manger and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Woljif Romance Mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

## Known Issues/Conflicts

- **WARNING**: This mod does create save dependencies!
- This mod can be broken by enabling certain features of Toybox that interact with dialog trees, such as the "Make Previously Chosen Answers More Clear," "Disable Dialog Restrictions," "Preview Dialog Results," and "Expand Answers for Conditional Responses" features. Please turn these off while using Woljif Romance Mod.

And credit where it's due to the TableTopTweaks mod, from which all content in the TTT_Content folder is shamelessly stolen!
